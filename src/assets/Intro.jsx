          <p>Hi, I'm Sumit Kumar. I have done my B.Tech from IIT Guwahati. I'm passionate about problem-solving, and I actively participate in competitive programming on platforms like Codeforces, AtCoder, and LeetCode. I also have a strong interest in web development and have built several projects using the MERN stack, including applications focused on real-time communication, healthcare, data analysis, and data management. In addition to my technical skills, I enjoy watching sitcoms and listening to music, which helps me unwind and stay creative. I'm always eager to learn and collaborate on exciting projects that push the boundaries of technology.</p>
